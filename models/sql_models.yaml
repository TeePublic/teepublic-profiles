# SQL Template Models for Complex Transformations
# These models allow JOINs and transformations that can't be done in inputs.yaml

models:
  # Combined filtered identifies - excludes anonymous_ids that connect too many user_ids
  # This prevents giant clusters from forming during ID stitching
  #
  # How it works:
  #   1. Unions JS and Ruby identify events
  #   2. Finds "super-connector" anonymous_ids (connecting to >5 distinct user_ids)
  #   3. Excludes those anonymous_ids from the output
  #
  # Threshold: >5 distinct user_ids (balances filtering bots vs. legitimate multi-device users)
